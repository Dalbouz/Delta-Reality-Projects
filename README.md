Hardware: Nuc, 55' Touch monitor, Orbbec Femto bolt camera

Description: A photobooth app that uses Orbbec Femto bolt camera for user detection and user cutout. The app is made out of few stages where the user can pick a language out of the 3 selected languages, select a background, take the picture and send the picture to its email. Also the user needs to agree to the GDPR that is inside the app and we use a certain algoritam to check if the email is written correctly. The email that is sending the picture from is a stores email inside the .json file. The protocol for sending the email is SMTP and the email is send with a preloaded subject and description that can be changed inside the .json file.
For the languages we use the i2 localization package. From this is a photobooth template project was created for every other future photobooth app.
