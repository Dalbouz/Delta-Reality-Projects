**Client: Europa Park Germany**

Hardware: Nuc, 55' Touch monitor, Orbbec Femto bolt camera

Description: A photobooth app that uses Orbbec Femto bolt camera for user detection and user cutout. The app is made out of few stages where the user can pick a language out of the 3 selected languages, select a background, take the picture and send the picture to its email. Also the user needs to agree to the GDPR that is inside the app, we use a certain algoritam to check if the email is written correctly. The email that is sending the picture is stored inside the .json file. The protocol for sending the email is SMTP and the email is send with a preloaded subject and description that can be changed inside the .json file.
For the languages we use the i2 localization package. From this is a photobooth template project was created for every other future photobooth app.
